# 🧩 Data Structures & Algorithms Progress Tracker

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Journey** — a personal roadmap to mastering core concepts, patterns, and problem-solving techniques used in technical interviews.

This repository tracks my progress through major **DSA patterns** (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, DFS/BFS, Dynamic Programming, etc.) along with the **data structures** they rely on.
